# Student-Performance-Analysis

This project analyzes student performance based on various attributes such as study time, family background, and other factors. The goal is to identify key factors influencing students' final grades and build a Multiple Linear Regression Model to predict academic performance.

## Dataset Details
The dataset consists of student demographic information, academic performance, and lifestyle habits, including:
- **Demographics**: Age, Gender, Address Type (Urban/Rural)
- **Academic Factors**: Study Time, Past Failures, Extra Educational Support
- **Family & Social Factors**: Parents’ Education, Family Support, Relationship Status
- **Lifestyle Factors**: Free Time, Alcohol Consumption, Absences

## Tasks Performed
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handling missing values and outliers.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying correlations between different factors.
- **Feature Engineering**: Selecting relevant features for model training.
- **Model Implementation**: Using Multiple Linear Regression to predict final grades.
- **Evaluation**: Measuring performance with R-squared, RMSE & MAE.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy** – Data Processing
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Data Visualization
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine Learning
